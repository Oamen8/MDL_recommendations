Recommendation algorithm for mydramalist.com/. Currently set output recommendations for user 'Oamen' (my personal account). Any user can be inputted by username in the second code cell of both MDL_cleaning.ipynb and MDL_model.ipynb.

MDL_cleaning.ipynb uses requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape review data from the top 100 contributors on MyDramaList (MDL) as the basis for making recommendations for the given user. For reasonable web scraping processing time, the data set was limitted to shows and movies with at least 15 ratings and a median rating of at least 7.0 from the top 100 contributors. Two lead actors/actresses, two genres, and the country of origin are collected from each title as features.

MDL_model.ipynb uses cosine similarity to determine user similarity between the given user and the top contributing users. The model weights the ratings of the most similar users to calculate recommendations for the inputted user. Previously collected features are then considered in a second recommendation algorithm only considering data from the inputted user. Features are weighted against the user's ratings are given a normalized importance score, which is used to calculate a new list of recommendations.
